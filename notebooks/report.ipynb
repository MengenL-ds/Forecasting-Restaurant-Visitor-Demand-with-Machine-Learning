Dining bars and Italian/French cuisines are also well-represented, reflecting popularity in Western-style dining. Bar/Cocktail and Japanese food hold moderate representation, while genres like Yakiniku/Korean food, Okonomiyaki/Monja/Teppanyaki, and Creative cuisine have smaller counts.

    "The markers indicate that restaurants are primarily concentrated in urban and economically significant regions, with major clusters around Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyushu. The Tokyo metropolitan area has the densest grouping, consistent with its high population density and tourism demand. Other noticeable clusters appear in Kansai (Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto area) and parts of southern Japan, while northern and rural regions have fewer establishments.\n",

    "The most dominant category is Japanese-style cuisine, with nearly 1,800 stores, reflecting the strong cultural and consumer preference for traditional Japanese food. Other notable categories include International cuisine (~700 stores), Grilled meat, and Creative cuisine, each showing significant representation. Meanwhile, genres such as French, Spanish, and Dim Sum/Dumplings have only a small presence, indicating niche but specialized offerings. Overall, the chart highlights that HPG restaurants are heavily skewed toward Japanese and Asian cuisine, while Western and other international genres make up a smaller proportion of the total. This suggests a market largely driven by local tastes with some diversification toward global food trends.\n",

    "Tokyo dominates overwhelmingly, with over 2,000 restaurants, highlighting its position as the country’s largest metropolitan hub and a center for dining and tourism. Osaka follows distantly with just above 500 restaurants, while other prefectures such as Fukuoka, Hyōgo, and Hokkaidō have between 300–400 restaurants each. The remaining prefectures, including Shizuoka, Hiroshima, Niigata, and Miyagi, show much smaller counts, under 250 restaurants each. Interestingly, there is also a “None” category, which likely represents records with missing location data. Overall, the distribution indicates that HPG’s coverage is highly concentrated in Tokyo and major urban areas, while regional prefectures are much less represented."

    "Similar to the Air dataset, the restaurants are concentrated in major metropolitan areas, with a strong cluster around Tokyo and the Kanto region, as well as notable concentrations in the Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe) and Fukuoka in Kyushu. Smaller clusters appear in northern Japan (Tohoku and Hokkaido) and scattered areas along Honshu’s western coast. Compared to the Air dataset, HPG restaurants appear to have broader coverage across Japan, but still follow the same urban-centric trend, reflecting where population density and dining demand are highest. This reinforces the idea that restaurant availability and reservation activity are heavily influenced by urbanization and regional economic hubs."

    "The vertical spikes at 1 represent holidays across 2016 and early 2017. We can see that holidays are relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, with higher clustering in autumn and around New Year (late December to early January). These holiday periods are important because they typically lead to spikes in restaurant visits and reservations, reflecting cultural and seasonal dining patterns in Japan\n",

    "\n",
    "January stands out with the highest number of holidays (8), which is linked to New Year celebrations in Japan, a period of major travel and dining activity. May is another peak with 6 holidays, largely due to Golden Week, a cluster of consecutive national holidays that drives a sharp rise in restaurant visits. July, August, and December each have 4 holidays, aligning with summer festivals, Obon season, and year-end festivities, respectively. By contrast, June and September–October have the fewest holidays, reflecting quieter months for holiday-driven restaurant activity.\n",

    "\n",
    "The clear standout is Monday, with the highest count (9 holidays), followed by Thursday (7 holidays). This pattern suggests that holidays in Japan often extend weekends or create “long weekends,” especially when aligned with Mondays or Thursdays. Fridays and Saturdays also host a moderate number of holidays (5 each), while Sundays (4) are less common, since they are already a non-working day. On the other end, Tuesdays (2 holidays) and Wednesdays (3 holidays) see the fewest, making midweek holidays relatively rare."

    "The standout trend is that Izakaya restaurants dominate, especially on Fridays and Saturdays, where the intensity peaks (deep blue cells). This suggests that Izakayas are a go-to choice for weekend socializing and gatherings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another strong genre is Italian/French, which shows consistent reservations across the week, with higher intensity on Fridays and Saturdays as well—though not as concentrated as Izakayas. Japanese cuisine/Kaiseki and Dining bars also show weekend boosts, while most other genres (like cafes, grilled meat, or Western food) remain relatively low and steady throughout the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weekly pattern is clear: weekend days (Friday–Saturday, sometimes Sunday) see the largest spikes in reservations across almost all food genres, with weekdays (Monday–Thursday) being calmer. This reflects cultural dining behavior in Japan, where people tend to go out more for leisure eating and social drinking toward the end of the week.\n",

Italian/French restaurants also stand out with sustained high demand during the same period, though at a slightly lower intensity than Izakaya.\n",

    "Other categories such as Japanese cuisine/Kaiseki, Dining bars, and Western food show moderate weekly activity, but their intensity remains much lower in comparison. Most other genres—including cafés, creative cuisine, and bars—register very low and sporadic activity across weeks, highlighted by their faint shading in the heatmap.\n",

Notably, Izakaya and Japanese-style cuisine stand out with dense concentrations across many areas, especially in major urban centers like Tokyo and Osaka. Other categories, such as Italian/French, Café/Sweets, and Dining bars, are also widely spread but with smaller concentrations. Meanwhile, more niche cuisines (e.g., Thai/Vietnamese, Sichuan, or Spanish/Mediterranean) appear only sporadically across regions"
